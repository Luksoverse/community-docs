## Benefits

If you learn well, but are not technically able to set up your own server and security with your current knowledge, we can walk you through the entire process to ensure you get everything correct.

We explain things that you need to know, and at the same time let you set everything up at your own pace. We know the bugs and issues that you need to avoid, and we prepare you to handle future updates and troubleshooting.

Hiring us also gives you access to our VIP private discord with other home-stakers, where you get notifications and explanations about any updates to the network, and can ask questions or collaborate with other stakers.

## Staking Pools

If you prefer an effortless experience we will be launching staking pools in the near future that allow you to deposit your LYX to a decentralized contract developed by StakeWise. With these pools you pay the Stakingverse a small fee from the rewards you earnâ€¦ and we provide the infrastructure through our partners at Digital Ocean! Check out our active pools here [Stakingverse](https://stakingverse.io) project.

## Become a Pool Partner

If you have a lot of experience running nodes already, you can become a node operator partner and run pools with us. We share our infrastructure and fees with you. There are some minimum requirements, so contact our Technical Director for more details.
