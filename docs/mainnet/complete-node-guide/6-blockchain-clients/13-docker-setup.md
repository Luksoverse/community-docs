# LUKSO Docker Setup

> **WARNING**: The Modular Docker Images from LUKSO are not released yet. The guide will continue once they are publically available for both validator and non-validator setups.

Currently, only two repositories are provided:

- [Mainnet Geth-Prsym Docker Validator](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-docker-containers)
- [Mainnet Geth-Prsym Docker Monitoring](https://github.com/lukso-network/network-docker-monitoring)

You can look up their individual documentation if you are willing to use them. They are ready to use but not finalized.
