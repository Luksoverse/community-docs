# Grafana Notifications

**Caution: Grafana had breaking changes to notifications on the latest version. They have a [Legacy Notification Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/legacy-alerting/) on their end. However, we're currently trying to update the Dashboards so they can be used with the latest build. Please bear with us.**

This section of the guide is about setting up Grafana notifications for your node metrics via Telegram Images.
